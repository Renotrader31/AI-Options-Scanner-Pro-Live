- [ ] **Verify Real-Time P&L**:

#### **🕐 During Market Hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET):**
- [ ] **Monitor Portfolio Updates**: Click "Update Live Prices" button
- [ ] **Verify Options Contracts**:

### 📋 **Expected Behavior:**

**BEFORE (Current - After Hours):**
```
ONDS PUT: Entry $0.80 → Current $0.80 → P&L: +$320.00 (static)
GLXY PUT: Entry $1.70 → Current $1.70 → P&L: +$850.00 (static)  
```

**AFTER (Tomorrow - Market Hours):**
```
ONDS PUT: Entry $0.80 → Current $X.XX (live) → P&L: $XXX (dynamic)
GLXY PUT: Entry $1.70 → Current $Y.YY (live) → P&L: $YYY (dynamic)
```

### 🚨 **Success Criteria:**
1. ✅ Live option prices update during market hours
2. ✅ SELL TO OPEN positions show credits correctly (green when profitable)
3. ✅ P&L calculations match live market movements
4. ✅ No API errors or authentication issues
5. ✅ Portfolio updates work smoothly

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**
- **If prices still $0**: Check market hours, verify contracts exist
- **If 401 errors**: API key needs to be set in production environment
- **If wrong P&L**: Verify BUY vs SELL logic is working correctly
